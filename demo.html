			<p>On the other hand, <span>Wolf</span> denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of <span>Grandmother</span> of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty through weakness of will, which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil and pain.</p>

				<dd>Wolf</dd>
				<dt>Knock knock!</dt>

				<dd>Grandmother</dd>
				<dt>Who's there?</dt>

				<dd>Wolf</dd>
				<dt>It's me, your granddaughter, Little Red Riding Hood. I bear gifts, let me in. Pretty please?</dt>

				<dd>Grandmother</dd>
				<dt>Come in then.</dt>

				<dd>Cardinal Xim√©nez</dd>
				<dt>NOBODY expects the Spanish Inquisition!</dt>
				<dt>Our chief weapon is surprise...surprise and fear...fear and surprise.... Our two weapons are fear and surprise...and ruthless efficiency.... Our *three* weapons are fear, surprise, and ruthless efficiency...and an almost fanatical devotion to the Pope.... Our *four*...no... *Amongst* our weapons.... Amongst our weaponry...are such elements as fear, surprise.... I'll come in again.</dt>

			<p>These cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided.</p>
